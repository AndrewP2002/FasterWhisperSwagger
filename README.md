A casual project for transcribtion of audio/video files using FasterWhisper-XXL and ollama for the server side
and using swagger and ngrok for the client side.

If you want to use just go to the provided link (whenever the server is on)
use the upload function(up to 100 Mb) and upload an audio/video file then either select your prefered language you want to translate it to
or just set the translation as false. 
Afterwards, after awaiting a few minutes you will be able to download your selected subtitles



OLD:
Afterwards, if you selected false you will only get the original subtitles of the video/audio file and if you selected true
then you will get both the normal subtitles and the subtitles of your targeted language.
After a few minutes of subtitles generating, you can go into the system-messages section and check whether the generation has ended. (click execute and if it hasnt ended just wait a bit more and click again)
If it says that transcribtion for your file has ended you will be able to use the download-subtitles section where you will input the FULL name of your file(with extension)
after which you will get the the ability to see a download subtitles button and after clicking you will get a zip file downloaded containing your subtitles.
In the end, the subtitles have been downloaded all the files WILL BE DELETED, so be careful with your created subtitles!
